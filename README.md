Optim_iterator
==============

GA,DEA,PSO Python Optimization algorithm using multiprocessing

Modified souce code of the [inspyred](https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred) library.

None of the files was created by me but I modified them,for the needs of my Master Thesis, to enable:
- tracking of many responses except of the fitness
- solving DEA startegies: 
  * DE/best/1/exp
  * DE/rand/1/exp
  * DE/rand-to-best/1/exp
  * DE/best/2/exp
  * DE/rand/2/exp
  * DE/best/1/bin
  * DE/rand/1/bin
  * DE/rand-to-best/1/bin
  * DE/best/2/bin
  * DE/rand/2/bin

The DEA strategies were obtained from [PyGMO](http://esa.github.io/pygmo/index.html).

## Example

`python solve.py <folder name> <algorithm> <mutation rate> <crossover rate>`

where:
* *folder name* : defines where to store the output files
* *algorithm* : DEA, GA or PSO
* *mutation rate* : if DEA or GA is used
* *crossover rate* : if DEA or GA is used


The function implemented is the Styblinskiâ€“Tang optimization test function. Any other function can be used if implemented in the same way.
The optimization function can be mathemetical or the result of another script.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7+
- inspyred
- pyDOE to create initial population using Latin Hypercube
